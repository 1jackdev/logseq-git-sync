- "Friends, tonight we raise our glasses to the future. The future is full of unknowns, but that’s what makes it exciting. There will be moments that remind us why we follow our dreams, why we embrace change, and why its always important to remember to laugh.
  
  So here’s to bold choices, good company, and a future that keeps us inspired. To close, I'd like to share a excerpt from an Irish blessing:
  
  "May the road rise to meet you
  May the wind be always at your back
  May the warm rays of sun fall upon your home
  And may the hand of a friend always be near.
  
  May green be the grass you walk on,
  May blue be the skies above you,
  May pure be the joys that surround you,
  May true be the hearts that love you."
  
  To the future—cheers!
